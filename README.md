# Ng2-Webpack-With-CDN
Angular2 web app with Webpack

I have started playing with JavascriptServices from HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/ASPNET/JAVASCRIPTSERVICES .

I wanted to have a CDN project which contains, all shared components for another projects. 

To get Started,
1) install npm via --> npm i -g (-g to install globally) 
2) install Webpack via --> npm i webpack
3) Please run npm install on Angular2Spa and Angular2CDN project folder to get all node_modules. 
4) In Angular2Spa project, run webpack --config webpack.config.vendor.js to generate wwwrooot/dist/ folder with vendor.js
5) execute in command prompt, webpack to get your application ready for browsing.

That's it!
